# Desktop.ini

Starting near midnight on June 8th 2020, I have begun to upload desktop.ini files to this directory. How I think they work is Windows reads the INI files first, and performs what they say. With this, I can show all the same icons on another computer running Windows. I just recently realized you can unhide the files. Their source is editable, and these files will help set up the icon system once you extract/view the repository.

This won't be the only architecture, I already have plans on integrating KDE support, I have done testing with that on other projects. I plan to have multiple supported architectures.
