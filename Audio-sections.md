# Audio sections

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/wiki/)

There are a limited number of audio sections in the collection, but they serve a unique purpose. Audio sections start with a single uppercase letter (example: `A section/` or `0 section/`) they help wall off playlists from one another, but most importantly, when a key on the keyboard is pressed (example: `H`) it will automatically select the `H section/` directory, and then you can begin to search for playlists starting with H (I keep it sorted A-Z, this is required for this trick to work properly) sections have files listing index the playlists in the section. Not all sections contain listing files at the moment.

Audio sections are not limited to English characters. There are also sections for numbers 0 to 9, sections for `!` and (currently only in the sound effects directory) sections for Cyrillic characters (the current only one being `П` - Pe)

In the main music directory `1 Music/` letter sections have an uppercase, with a space, following the lowercase version of the letter.
