# Audio series

An audio series (in terms of this audio collection) is a playlist of playlists. Series are active in the 2 main master directories `(1 Music/)` and `(3 Sound effects/)` They do not appear in the other mode `(2 Music (projectless)/)` or the `(0 Overview/)` directory. these playlists usually follow a theme. It can be a series of games, a series of products, and more.

Audio series start with a `!` in the name so that they appear at the top. There is only a single `!`, never a double or triple `!`
